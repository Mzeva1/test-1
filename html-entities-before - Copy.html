		<h1>Don't be afraid to be &lt;then a 100% sucess &amp; &gt;more</h1>

			&quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marrred by dust and sweet and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, so this place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat.&quot;
