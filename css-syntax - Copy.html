	<h1>ECONOMICS</h1>
	
	<p>Economics is a science that studies how societies allocate scarce resources among alternative uses and how individuals and institutions make choices under conditions of scarcity. It involves analysing and understanding the production, consumption and distribution of goods and services.</p>
	
	<p>Economy is the system of production, distribution and consumption of goods and services in a particular geographic area, such as a country or region. It includes all economic activities and transactions that take place within that area.</p>
	<p>Indirect costs refer to costs that are not directly related to the production or consumption of a good or service, but have an impact on it nonetheless. In the context of school attendance, indirect costs can include things like transportation costs, school uniforms, and textbooks. These costs can have a significant impact on school attendance, particularly for low-income families. </p>
