		<h2>Ways to prevent famine</h2>
		<p>Famine is a complex issue that can have many underlying causes such as drought, conflicts, and poor agricultural practices, among others. Therefore, preventing famine requires a multi-faceted approach that involves various stakeholders, including the government, communities, NGOs, and other development partners. Here are some ways that the Kenyan government can do to prevent famine:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Investing in drought-resistant crops.</li>
			<li>Improving irrigation systems.</li>
			<li>Providing food aid and support to vulnerable communities.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In conclusion, famine prevention requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach that involves different stakeholders. The Kenyan government can play a critical role in preventing famine by investing in agricultural infrastructure, promoting sustainable land use practices, and providing social safety net programs to vulnerable communities, among other measures.</p>
